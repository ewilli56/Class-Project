<center><h2> Step 1: Find a Secure Location </h2>

<center><p>Try to find the safest place you can to change a tire. Ideally, pull off to a quiet side street or a parking lot and park on a flat section of pavement.

If the tire blew out while driving, slowly reduce your speed, turn on your hazard lights and look for a safe spot to pull over away from traffic, such as the shoulder of an off ramp. If there is no exit nearby, locate a long straight section of highway and pull over in the emergency lane or on the shoulder of the road, as far away from traffic as you can.

If it is evening or late night, try to find a well-lit area and turn on the dome light inside your car.

Put the car in park and engage the parking brake to help keep the car from rolling.

Place wheel wedges against both wheels opposite the one that is flat.

Keep alert and aware of your surroundings when exiting your vehicle and during the entire process.</p></center>

<center><h2> Step 2: Jack the Car Up </h2>

<p>Take off the wheel cover. 
With the wrench, loosen the lug nuts, but do not remove them.
Consult your owner's manual to find the proper placement for the jack and to operate it. Follow the instructions and place the jack under the vehicle frame next to the tire that is flat. Unless prohibited by the instructions, you can help stabilize the jack by placing a cut from a 2- x 6-inch piece of wood under it, then positioning it under the car.
Using the jack, raise the car until the flat tire has a clearance of six inches.</p>

<center><h2> Step 3: Remove the Tire </h2>

  	</a>

<p>Remove the lug nuts from the wheel and place them all together in a safe place. The floor of the front seat or inside the door pocket are a good place to keep them while you work.
With both hands, take hold of the flat and pull it towards you until it slides off the hub. Set the flat tire aside.</p>
</center>

<center><h2> Step 4: Put on the Spare </h2>

  	<a target="_blank" href="https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-change-a-tire-step-4.jpg">
    		<img class="_blank" src="https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-change-a-tire-step-4.jpg" alt="Cinque Terre" width="600" height="400">
  	</a>

<p>Line up the spare tire with wheel bolts and push it into place.
Replace each lug nut, turning by hand in a clockwise direction to tighten. Tighten the nuts in a star pattern - move to the next nut across, rather than one adjacent - to be sure the wheel mounts evenly.
Use the wrench for one turn if you need to be sure the tire is secure, but do not completely tighten all the bolts while the tire is in the air.</p>
</center>

<center><h2> Step 5: Lower the Car </h2>

  	<a target="_blank" href="https://contentgrid.homedepot-static.com/hdus/en_US/DTCCOMNEW/Articles/how-to-change-a-tire-step-5.jpg">

  	</a>

<p>Lower the car with the jack so that the spare tire is just resting on the ground; the full weight of the car should not yet be on it. 
Use the wrench to completely tighten the lug nuts, following the same star pattern as before. Push down on the wrench with your full body weight to be sure the lug nuts are very tight.
Replace the wheel cover then lower the jack and remove it.
Check the tire pressure with a tire gauge. If needed, add air with a portable tire inflator, or if you do not have one, slowly drive to the nearest gas station.</p>
