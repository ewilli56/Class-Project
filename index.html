	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Evon Williams, I am a 26-year-old, I was born in Decatur, Georgia and I am currently in the United States Air Force, stationed at McConnell Airforce Base in Wichita, Kansas. I spent most of my life living between Georgia and New York before joining the Air force 2 years ago. I have three siblings, two brothers and one sister, of which I am the second oldest. At the age of 17 I attended Savannah State University, an HBCU located in Savannah, Georgia where I pursued my Bachelor of Fine Arts. After 3 years of school, I decided to take a break a travel around the world to places like Japan, China, Italy, Brazil, Egypt and more. I love Art, video games, anime, and traveling.

			Growing up I loved video games and I loved art, they are the top two things in my life right now that I have the biggest passion for. Video games ultimately lead my to coding which also lead me to graphic design. The video game that had the biggest impact on me is called RuneScape. RuneScape is an MMORPG that had a huge underground modification following, being as it was coded in Java. Wanting to create and host my very own version of the game forced me to also want to learn coding. Forums played a big part in not only me learning coding but also learning graphic design. The coding forums for the game were like any business, the best advertisements got the most traffic. The top modified servers had unique custom banners, Avatars, spirits, and more. I wanted to be at the top, I wanted to look like the best and be the best. This forced me to learn coding, photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver. As the work got easier, it got more fun, eventually I knew what I wanted to do with my life.
